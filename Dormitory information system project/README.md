here is  what we   try to implement in this code;
in dorm we have to many entities and participators 
like
student, proctor, leader(we say admin), room, building
in between them there are so many action even we couldn't implement in this code. because it do need so much time plus resourses
the other is about the function about this code;
admin can add proctor, student and Admin like him self
admin can add new building to system
proctor can add/remove material to each dorm room, add/remove student to/from each dorm and search student;
studnent can search their dorm, by inserting their name
the name we used as username in this code.

additionnaly we write so many methods we did'nt use yet. 
but we tried to minimize the project then we stop building more methods.

lastly if you wanted to make me understand a few don't tell me you can't do this, just tell me how to do it.
