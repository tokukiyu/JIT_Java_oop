# Dorm Management System

Welcome to the Dorm Management System! This code aims to provide a streamlined approach to managing various entities and participants within a dormitory setting. We have focused on key entities such as students, proctors, leaders (referred to as admins), rooms, and buildings.

## Key Entities and Actions

- **Entities:**
  - Student
  - Proctor
  - Admin (Leader)
  - Room
  - Building

- **Actions:**
  - Admin has the power to:
    - Add proctors, students, and admins (like themselves)
    - Add new buildings to the system

  - Proctor has the ability to:
    - Add/remove materials to each dorm room
    - Add/remove students to/from each dorm
    - Search for students

  - Students can:
    - Search for their dorm by inserting their username

## Code Functionality

Our code includes a range of methods to support the outlined functionality. However, due to time and resource constraints, not all potential actions have been implemented. We acknowledge the existence of additional actions that could enhance the system, but we aimed to create a functional foundation first.

## Unimplemented Methods

In the pursuit of project minimization, we have written several methods that remain unused at the moment. These methods may be implemented in the future to extend the functionality of the system.

## Future Development

While the current version of the Dorm Management System is functional, there is potential for expansion and improvement. We encourage further development, especially in implementing additional actions and making use of the existing methods.

## Your Feedback

Your feedback is invaluable to us! If you have suggestions or specific features you'd like to see added, please share your thoughts. We are open to continuous improvement and strive to make this Dorm Management System a more comprehensive and user-friendly solution.

Remember, if you encounter challenges, we won't say "you can't do this." Instead, we'll guide you on how to overcome those challenges and enhance your understanding of the code. Happy coding!
